            <p class="par">The History Of Palasdeo Temple
                This temple is at least 800 to 900 years old.This is the Palasnath temple of Lord Shiva which belonged to the Palasdeo village. The village was relocated.The temple is built in the Hemadpanthi style and the Shikhar is built in the Saptabhumij style, with a space and a small dome in the Shikhar where 6â€“7 people can sit and perform havan and pooja. This is a rare sort of Shikhar seen in temples in these places.

                Palasdev is located 190 kilometres from Pune on the Pune-Solapur route, and most Maharashtra and Karnataka buses stop there frequently. After arriving in Palasdeo, we first witness the new village that was built after the previous one was flooded.            </p>
